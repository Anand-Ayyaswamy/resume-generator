Try it : https://nitish6174.github.io/resume-generator/

#### Editing content
- Edit the Resume content just like a normal document editor (cut,copy,undo etc).
- Entire sections can be added, reordered, removed just by cut,copy,pasting method.
- Thus, to remove a section/point/mentor/link etc, just delete it.
- To insert bold/italics/formatted text, copy a part of already existing formatted text to where you want and edit it. (Just like we can do in text editors)
- Use "Insert sub-list" button to insert sub-points in a point. (like as in achivements section)
- Change indentation and bullet style of the list where your cursor is placed.
- Use the options in the left panel to modify the template.

#### Printing
- Use Google Chrome to print as PDF. (Other browsers are unable to print properly)
- Adjust margin in the print dialog box. You may need it if a section is getting split between two pages. Print each page separately with different margins if needed.
- If URLs or some stray text is being shown in print preview, disable the options "Include headers and footers","Include background graphics" etc in the print dialog box.

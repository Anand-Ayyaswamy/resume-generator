Try it : https://nitish6174.github.io/resume-generator/

#### Usage
- Edit the Resume content just like a normal document editor (cut,copy,undo etc).
- Entire sections can be added, reordered, removed just by cut,copy,pasting method.
- To insert bold/italics text, copy a part of already existing formatted text to where you want and edit it. (Just like we can do in text editors)
- Use the options in the left pane to modify the template.

#### Printing
- Use Google Chrome to print as PDF. (Other browsers are unable to print properly)
- Adjust margin in the chrome's print dialog.
You may need it if a section is getting split between two pages.
Print each page separately with different margins if needed.
